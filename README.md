Drishti *(Nepali: दृष्टि | English: Vision)* is an open-source cross-platform mobile application project at Incubate Nepal that incorporates Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to help visually impaired people recognize different currency bills and perform daily cash transactions more effectively.
