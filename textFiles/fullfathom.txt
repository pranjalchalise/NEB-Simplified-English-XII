Full Fathom Five Thy Father Lies is a poem extracted from Shakespear's play ;the Tempest , act I scene II. 

The song is sung by spirit Ariel for Ferdinand , the prince of Naples who thinks his father has drowned. The prince feels immensely sad on his father's death. Seeing this the ariel sympathises and consoles him by saying that his father's life hasnâ€™t been wasted after death. Infact is transformed into something valuable. For his father is now thirty feet below the sea and has been warmly welcomed by the sea nymphs. His bone is transformed into beautiful corals and his eyes has changed into pearls. His death has been meaningful as every part of his body has been changed into something rich and strange. He has been welcomed by the sea nymph with honour as they ring the 'ding dong' bell for his death and considers him to be a part of their family now. Nothing of him has faded, but suffered a sea change.  

Humans are a part of nature so  after death they are submerged into it.  Life is never wasted but is transformed into something valuable is gist of this poem. Hence life is equally meaningful after death.
