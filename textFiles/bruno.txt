Summary 

Bruno Bettelheim's interpretation the folk-tale 'Hansel and Gretel' is a psychological analysis. The story focuses on the bitter truth that scarcity , poverty and hardships  lead to selfishness. That is why the step-mother compels her husband to send away his children to that they can live comfortably. Due to the wrong doings of  their step-mother , the children suffer a lot. But in the process, they grow up and learn to face the problems of their life as well. It can also be perceived  that children need to learn to live independently. So the fact that they are abandoned by their father and step-mother  gives them a chance to become independent, strong and wise.  

The interpretation also reveals how greed and temptation lead to self-destruction. Being greedy means inviting trouble to oneself. Had the children not been tempted to the gingerbread house , they wouldn't have been trapped by the witch. But eventually, they realize this and manage to kill the witch and secure themselves. They also manage to take the jewels from the witch and return to their father. But they suffer quite a lot to get the jewels. This shows that there is no gain without pain. 

The story can also be interpreted from the cultural view. The white duck that helps the children to cross the river is a symbol of co-operation and selflessness. Since only one person is able to cross the road at a time in the duck, the children learn to become independent . They learn that they should be able to be on their own because no one will be with them forever. The expanse of water is a symbolizes maturity. The bird leading the children to the witch's house represents peace. These things have greatly contributed to make the children independent, bold and wise.
