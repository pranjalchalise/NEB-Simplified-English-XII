Summary 

Jack Zipes interprets the story of 'Hansel and Gretel' in a Marxist perspective. According to this view, there are two types of class in the society i.e. the upper class and the lower class and there is always conflict between the classes. The upper class people are the dominating and supressing ones while the lower class people are always the oppressed and weak ones. 

The father loves his children a lot but is forced to leave them in the jungle due to his wife. He doesnâ€™t want to send his children away but cannot do anything against his wife. So in the story the woodcutter and his children signify the lower class people who are oppressed by the step-mother and the witch who signify the upper class people.  

The woodcutter family represents poverty while the witch represents aristocracy and feudalism. In the beginning the witch seems a very kind hearted and helpful person but what she really intends on doing  is eating the children. The fake pretences of aristocrats is exposed here. The struggle shown in the story is against the feudal system and aristocracy. Lower class and poor people in the eighteenth century had to struggle a lot due to scarcity and famine. The rich people made it very difficult for them to even survive. The story  gives emphasis to hope and victory . The ultimate death of witch signifies  victory over feudal system and feudal ideology. It shows the transformation of feudalism towards capitalism. The story also gives a clear message that we can change out conditions if we struggle actively and rebel against the injustice.
